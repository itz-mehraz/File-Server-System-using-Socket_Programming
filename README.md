### Project Features:

- **Server Initialization:** Upon loading the server system, it automatically sets up the necessary communication infrastructure to enable client connections.

- **Client Connectivity:** The client system prompts users to input the IP address and port number of the server to establish a connection.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The system incorporates a user-friendly GUI with directory services that display available directories and files.

- **File Operations:** Both uploading and downloading files are facilitated through context-menu operations (right-click mouse actions). Clients can upload files to the server, and download files from it.

### Technical Details:

- **Technology Stack:** Java, TCP/IP Socket Programming.

- **User Interface:** Developed using Java AWT and Swing libraries.

- **File Compatibility:** Supports various file formats including .txt, .xlsx, .pdf, images, .mp4, and other audio and video formats.

- **Functionality:** Allows clients to browse server directories, select files for download, upload files to the server, and enables server-side file deletion.
